## Design Handoff Project

This week we implemented a [design](<https://www.figma.com/file/FVoujOAxjDFHMYFVO8M7Gj/Template-Designer-Developer-Handover-(Grace)>) made by a UX-designer. We used React and focused on styling with Tailwind.css.

## The Problem

First we got a presentation of the design by our designer Grace Wetterlund. We then worked both synchronously (in pair-pogramming) and asynchronously with different parts of the design. We styled the project using Tailwind.css which we both thought was a straight-forward and logic method for styling.

We had continuous communication with our designer during the week and that made the process smooth and we could pay alot of attention to the coding.
