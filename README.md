### Design Handoff Project

For this project, we were provided with a design for a fitness club from a UX student and the goal was to follow the design as closely as possible using a new styling framework - styled components or Tailwind CSS. We decided to go for Tailwind.

The design can be found here:

### The Problem

Our main problem with working with Tailwind was navigating the tradeoff between following the design by the pixel and customizing in Tailwind or use Tailwinds preset widths/margins/font sizes. We have configurated certain things such as colors, viewport sizes and certain font sizes but for the paddings and margins we went with the approach "as close as possible" with the default pixels. We ended up enjoying working with Tailwind but in the future, we would prefer working from a design tailored for Tailwind and it's various viewports.
