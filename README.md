# Design Handoff Project

This is a project that I worked with one of students from UI/UX class at Technigo. This beautiful design was designed by Thomas Fredrik Read.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I quickly realised that it is not easy to follow a designer's design, as they look great, but to code them was very tricky. Some parts had a completely different structure for mobile and desktop, so I had to play around to find a solution.
I struggled the most with creating a form animation that needed to be triggered when a button was clicked. This was a trial and error process that took me hours to finally find a solution. It also helped to know that a passionate designer would check all the details. So I tried to communicate well with him to know what he wanted. It was so much fun to work with a designer who is really passionate about design. I really appreciate him and am happy to work with such a talented designer.
