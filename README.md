# Design Handoff Project
In Week 12, we were supposed to work with a UX design student and build their design using Styled Components or Tailwind. I missed out this week and had to catch up later and doing it by myself.

## Getting Started with the Project
I decided to use styled components for the project. I started creating all the components for each section of the the template and then I started working on them one by one. However looking back, a lot of the code is repeated across components. Reusing styled components could have helped reduce code. I plan to clean this up at a later time. Realizing now that if I had structured and organized from the beginning the code would be more manageable and styles wouldn't conflict with each other, allowing for more dynamic styling.

### The Problem
The design template I worked with was really advanced, with a cool layout. It was definitely a challenge to follow, to say the least! I struggled especially with the slider library and its arrows/dots. This was also my first time using placeholders, and while I did my best, they were tricky and far from perfect. Another challenge was getting the images to change transparency and rearrange on different viewports. Overall, it was a tough project, but I did my best to follow the design as closely as I could.
