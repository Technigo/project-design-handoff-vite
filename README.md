# Design Handoff Project

## The Problem

This week we're practicing working with a designer, by turning Catrine's design into a website.

This is a collab project between [sofia32057] and [vittoriamatteoli], where we divided the components and built it async, while communicating throughout (devs, as well as designer). Any changes have been approved by Catrine and are documented by comments in Figma.

We decided to use styled components and keep it as simlpe as possible, to focus on the design.
Will go back and add global styling at a later point.

### Requirements

- The app should be built with React
- Use one of these design libraries:
  - Styled components
  - Tailwind CSS
- Your app should have reusable components
- Make your app responsive (it should look good on devices from 320px width up to 1600px)
- Your app should look as close as possible to the given design
