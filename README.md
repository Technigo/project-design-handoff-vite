# Design Handoff Project
For this weeks project we've collaborated with a UX designer, Jennifer from the UX course. She has made a christmas charity app where the user can donate money, clothes, christmas gifts and food for children. We've built a responsive app with React using styled-components.

### The Problem
We had a lot of problems with the responsive design this week. Firstly we only styled the version for mobile in the exact measurments the designer gave us. It was hard to make it look good on different devices afterwards. For next time, a good idea would be to include the responsive design already in the planning stage if possible. Then the responsive design will be easier to adjust later on. In the end we made it work but it took us a very long time. If we had more time we would continue working on the responsiveness to make it look more similar to the design for desktop and tablet.
