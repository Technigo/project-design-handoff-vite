# Design Handoff Project

This project is a collaborative effort to design a hand-off from a UX design student and transform it into a landing page. It involves showcasing the use of React, incorporating reusable components, and leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling all while adhering to the design specifications.
Additionally, it demonstrates the integration of npm packages for enhanced functionality, such as image carousels to enhance the user experience.

### The Problem

The UX design only had three responsive breakpoints, therefore I configured custom screen sizes to include more breakpoints and made the decisions for styling the additional breakpoints all while maintaining the original design.
