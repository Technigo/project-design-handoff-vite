# Design Handoff Project

For this week's assignment we were given a design by one of the UX-design students. The task was to realise the design in code and style it using either Tailwind CSS or Styled Components. Our design was by Mandana Amiri. 

### The Problem

We first created a sketch of the component layout using Figma. We decided to use Tailwind CSS for styling. Any questions about the design that arose duing the project were brought up with the designer, who was very helpful during the whole process.
