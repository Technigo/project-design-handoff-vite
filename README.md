# Design Handoff Project

This is the project collab with the designer from the UX track of Technigo.
Initially this was a group project, but as the other participants did not contribute in fixing the previous errors I am handing it in by myself this last time.

### The Problem
We startet up discussing with the designer,asking questions about the execution as there were multiple areas who was not described down to a "pixel" some parts had noe design at all, and she did not have time to finalize it, so we needed to compromize.
Then we split the elements of the page between us developers, and started to work on the different parts.
at the end of the  week (thursday) we worked to get the pieces to work togheter.
We had a sit down with the designer as well and did some final adjustments before handing in the project.
