# Design Handoff Project

This project was all about transforming a design from a UX design student into code. The theme of the site is a yoga webpage for women around menopause.
My designer had done a pretty good job in making a clear and descriptive Figma file, and we had a good communication around what was a little unclear. 


### The Problem

This was also my first week implementint i18n, and I realised to late how to plan my work this week. The translation took a lot of time from me, but by keeping on it, updating the translation files time and time again, I got through it. It did although make it hard to find time to make things like the image carousel in the courses section look good in desktop. This is something I would like to go back to. 
I would also have liked to spend more time on exploring different libraries.
