# Design Handoff Project

This week we recieved a design from a UX student to follow as precisely as possible.


### The Problem

We decided to use Styled Components for CSS to work on our UI. At first it required some practise but after some repetition, the workflow gets really fun. It's a bit time consuming to not have all the CSS rules built in, so it's been a learning-by-trying-out many different solutions and commands.
