# Design Handoff Project

This React project involves collaboration among three developers and a designer to closely replicate a provided design. The focus is on using styled components and creating reusable components to ensure consistency and maintainability.

### The Problem

We approached the project by starting with a to-do list of basic tasks, which we expanded as the project progressed. Each task was assigned to a team member, and we tracked progress by checking off completed items. Our workflow included frequent team meetings and active communication through a Slack group chat to divide tasks and provide feedback. We utilized Git with feature branches for collaborative development and created a detailed step-by-step guide for the Git workflow in Notion.

For tools and technologies, we used React for the core development and styled-components for creating reusable and consistent styles. Figma served as our reference for design details, allowing us to ask questions and accurately replicate spacing and layout values. React-Slick was implemented for the image carousel feature. Additionally, we leveraged YouTube, community resources, and AI tools for guidance and problem-solving.
Looking forward, if given more time, we would enhance the layout for tablet and desktop views to improve responsiveness. We would also explore implementing a feature to display the most recent seven Instagram images for the dog kennel, which would require resolving API permissions.
