# Design Handoff Project

A project in which a design was provided by a ux/ui student. Focus on learning how to implement an existing design while establishing, and improving, communication and cooperation with a designer.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

A very interesting project meant to showcase real life working conditions. The project started off with a brief from the designer and then an opportunity to ask questions regarding the design. I asked my questions and then got started.
Tools and frameworks used: HTML, CSS, React, React Hooks, Figma, React Router.
I really feel like I have learned a lot from this project and I enjoyed the process.
