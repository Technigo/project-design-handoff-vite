# Design Handoff Project

## Getting Started with the Project

### The Problem

This week we got a design from one of the design students and our instructions were to put the design into code and make the page come alive.
We started by talking about how to structure the project with the components then the coding began. We worked mostly ansynchronous and keep each other in touch via Slack.
The Responsivness took way longer than we though in the beginning but it worked out quite well in the end.
Altough it wasn't part of the instructions we wanted to add some functionality therefore the select as well as the hamburger menu are working.
