# Design Handoff Project

NOT COMPLETED!

We got a design andoff from a UX-design student and it is a landing page for a fitness club that we are going to build in React.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
