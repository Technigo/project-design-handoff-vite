# Design Handoff Project

The task was to implement a UX students design.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I built a structure with components from scratch. With external React libraries incl. translation with i18next. If I had more time, I would have continued to polish all the incredible amount of css that a project like this requires. And I would have had more meetings with the designer to discuss details of the project.
