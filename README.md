# Design Handoff Project

In this task, we will collaborate to transform a UX design student's mobile wireframe into a functional React application. Our focus will be on creating a responsive, mobile-first design that adheres closely to the provided specifications. We will utilize Styled Components for styling and explore npm packages to enhance the user experience with features like image carousels or animations. This project will emphasize effective communication and collaboration with designers while addressing potential implementation challenges.run dev

### The Problem

During our project, we encountered several challenges while working with Styled Components, particularly since it was a new styling methodology for our team. The learning curve added extra time to our development process as we adjusted to this new way of handling styles. Debugging became a bit more difficult because the generated class names do not always clearly indicate their associated styles, making it challenging to trace issues back to specific components.
