### Project
This project involves collaborating with UX design students to transform their landing page designs into functional React components for a fitness club. The goal is to create a responsive and visually accurate website using React and Tailwind CSS, incorporating features like a navigation header, hero section, registration form with various states, and a detailed footer.

### The Problem

Setting up Tailwind CSS for the first time presented challenges, as did closely following the designer's layout and style specifications. Adjusting to these requirements was a key learning curve in the project.
