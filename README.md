# Design Handoff Project

This weeks project was about transforming a design from a UX-design student. The design was for a landing page for a fitness club, and we are building it in React. The site also needed to be translated into at least one other language.

### The Problem

After the initial handover (handshake) I started working on the project. It soon became clear that the design wasn't responsive (the mobile-view was the size of tablet for instance), and that was a huge challenge because it was basically impossible to follow the design (in Figma). There was quite a lot of inconsistency, with differnet margins and wrong font-sizes for mobile for instace.

I had many conversations with the designer, and she continued to work on the design during the week to try to give me designs that was missing in the first draft. Mid-week I had to inform her that it's not possible for me to implement all the other changes that she did every day, and she was ok with that. I guess she, for her own sake, wanted to continue to develop the design to practice on her own - which is great, but just not convenient when someone's trying to build it ðŸ˜…. Even though these challenges, the collab itself went quite well.

Another challenge this week was internationalization, implementing i18n, to translate content into different languages. The implementation of it took much longer than I thougt - even thoung I got the hang of it after a while. I liked working with this as it draws parallels to my dayjob where I do some of the translations for the company. Now I got to see it from "the other side".

If I had more time I would've liked to follow the design exactly as the UX designer's original sketch, but it was simply not possible in the given time frame.
