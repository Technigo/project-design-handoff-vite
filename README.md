# Design Handoff Project

Week 11 project - a website for an imaginary climbing gym called Chalky.
Designed by Julia Rende from the UX/UI course, developed by Olga Lepist√∂.

### The Problem

After having the hand-off session with designer Julia, I started out by creating most of the bigger components. I started to build the site mobile-first.

This project was a constant stream of falling into rabbit holes: I kept figuring out ways to make the design structure better and spent hours upon hours restructuring things, getting stuck with bugs and then getting into the flow again. Even though I've spent the most time with this project than I have with any other project so far, I feel like I'm not even close to finishing - some major things are still missing, like the i18n languages, an image carousel and conditional styling logic for the form component.

However, I've loved making this project, it's possibly been my favourite so far. I've learned so much from stumbling with CSS over and over again, and will be wiser the next time. Now I'll need to put the development of this project to the side a little bit, but I'm proud of what I've made so far!
