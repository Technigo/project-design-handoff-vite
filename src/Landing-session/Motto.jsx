        A joyful adventure to self-discovery. Thatâ€™s our motto at MINI FLOW.

      <p>
        We combine age-appropriate poses, breathing exercises and mindfulness to
        encourage kids to explore their growing bodies and minds. By practicing
        yoga, we believe that kids will develop an important sense of
        self-awareness that they will benefit from their entire life.
      </p>

      <p>
        We combine creativity and playfulness in every session, using stories,
        games, and imagination to make yoga fun and lively. Our goal is to adapt
        all of our sessions to the energy of the kids that join us that day.
        Simply because we understand that kids can have good or bad days, that
        they sometimes are quiet and sometimes make noise, that some days they
        can sit still and some days like to jump around.
      </p>
      <p>Yoga is for all.</p>
